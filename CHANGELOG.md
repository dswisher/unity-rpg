Just starting out with the first [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2mK6KFdv0I).

I had some issues importing the assets, and while it looks like there are some fixes in the comments,
there is a lot going on there that I don't understand. So, I'm going to attempt to create a my own
minimalist scene, with placeholder objects made from primitives.

Create a ground, three obstacles, and materials for each.
